The ceremony was attended by Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad bin Sultan Al Qasimi, Crown Prince and Deputy Ruler of Sharjah.</p> <p>A total of 602 students graduated in various majors offered by the university at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p> <p>His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah congratulated the graduates and said:</p> <p>“This year coincided with the 20th anniversary celebrations of AUS. I am proud of its internationally recognized academic excellence. I feel that the efforts I made in setting up AUS have achieved the objectives of establishing a leading institution of high quality higher education in the region, on par in the quality of its academic programs with the top universities in the world.”</p> <p>His Highness shared with the audience the current plans of the university and said:</p> <p>“AUS launched the GCC’s first Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering program this Fall. This dynamic, multidisciplinary program is aimed at meeting an increasing demand for biomedical engineers in the healthcare industry and in biomedical research.”</p> <p>He also said AUS plans to launch two doctoral programs, one in engineering and the other in business administration. He said:</p> <p>“More doctoral programs are planned in our five-year strategic plan. Our focus will be on interdisciplinary programs focusing on medical technology, smart cities, artificial intelligence, the environment, and materials sciences.”</p> <p>Speaking on the occasion, AUS Chancellor Dr. Björn Kjerfve said:</p> <p>“AUS intends to be at the forefront of research and innovation in science and technology in support of an incubator for ideas, solutions, and commercialization. We intend to help Sharjah reap the benefits of our research and scholarship, to grow and be successful in achieving its goals, by focusing on regionally relevant research with a global impact.”</p> <p>The Chancellor also spoke about developments in the AUS doctoral programs and said:</p> <p>“How we are going to continue to build a world-class institution lies in the enormous challenge before us, in shifting our focus from being primarily a teaching-centric university to becoming a comprehensive research university offering PhD degrees, within five years, and without losing sight of our foundation and scholarship in the liberal arts.”</p> <p>“Graduates, as we send you on your way today, we want you to know that your university life is not at an end. In order for us to achieve our goal of being a successful research university, we need you to come back as graduate students and, in the future, post-doctoral students,” concluded Chancellor Kjerfve.</p> <p>The ceremony was also attended by Sheikh Mohammad bin Saoud Al Qasimi, Chairman of Sharjah Central Finance Department; Sheikh Khalid Bin Abdullah Al Qasimi, Chairman of the Seaport and Customs Department; Sheikh Salem bin Abdulrahman Al Qasimi, Chairman of the Ruler’s Office, Sheikh Mohammad bin Humaid Al Qasimi, Director of the Statistics and Social Development Department in Sharjah and a number of sheikhs.</p> <p>The ceremony was also attended by Rashid Ahmed bin Al Sheikh, Chairman of the Amiri Court; Abdullah Mohammad Al Owais, Chairman of the Cultural Department; Sultan Abdullah bin Haddah Al Suwaidi, Chairman of Economic Development Department in Sharjah; Khalid Jassim Al Midfa, Chairman of the Commercial and Tourism Development Department; Mohammad Obaid Al Zaabi, Chairman of the Protocol Department; Salem Al Qaseer, Chairman of the Labor Standards Development Authority; senior government and AUS officials.</p> <p>The breakdown of the graduates is as follows:</p> <p>Total number of graduating students: 602</p> <p>Number of undergraduate students receiving degrees: 531</p> <p>Number of graduate students receiving degrees: 71</p> <p>Number of male graduates: 328</p> <p>Number of female graduates: 274</p> <p>Total number of UAE nationals graduating: 104</p> <p>A breakdown of the graduating class by college/school is as follows:</p> <p>College of Architecture, Art and Design: 19 undergraduate and 6 graduate</p> <p>College of Arts and Sciences: 77 undergraduate and 6 graduate</p> <p>College of Engineering: 276 undergraduate and 43 graduate</p> <p>School of Business Administration: 159 undergraduate and 16 graduate</p> <p>The student speaker at the ceremony, Reem AlNuaimi, thanked His Highness for his efforts and the opportunity he provided to educate students. She said:</p> <p>“We found ourselves integrated within an international community that is AUS. It is easy to say that we have such a diverse community, but I am proud to say that we have truly made the most out of it. We became so integrated that our differences in nationality, religion and tradition became irrelevant to us. We started to realize that creativity, experience and innovation are what truly matter. I am grateful that AUS has gone a long way to give us this chance at integration.”</p> <p>“Perhaps it is not surprising that AUS is a place with a wide range of nationalities; as a matter of fact, we are in a country that is known for its diversity and multiculturalism. There are 5,675 students at AUS, with 1,097 of them being Emiratis, 768 Egyptians, 552 Indians, 24 Nigerians, 6 Koreans, and some students from Venezuela. These are just some examples of a total of 95 nationalities at American University of Sharjah,” she added.</p> <p>Founded in 1997, AUS has fulfilled His Highness Dr. Sheikh Sultan's vision of a quality institution catering to the aspirations and needs of the UAE and the wider Gulf community as a whole. Over the past decades, the student body increased considerably, necessitating the launch of two graduation ceremonies per year.</p> </div><a class="click" href="#news1"><span>+Read More</span><span>- Minimize</span></a></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="news-2"><div class="news-2-item" id="news2"><img src="https://www.aus.edu/sites/default/files/12%20Dec.JPG" alt="News Item 2 Image"><h3>AUS welcomes new students at Spring 2019 Orientation</h3><div class="body"><p>American University of Sharjah (AUS) held a welcome session for new students who will be joining the university as freshmen this semester. The event, which was held today, January 18, in the university’s Main Auditorium, provides incoming freshmen with a comprehensive understanding of academic and other aspects of life at AUS, and precedes an orientation week. The students, who comprise the top 20 percent of their high school classes, will begin attending classes when the Spring semester commences on January 27.</p> <p>Dr. Björn Kjerfve, Chancellor of AUS, welcomed the distinguished students to the university and apprised them of the opportunities, facilities and resources that awaited them at AUS. He wished them the best of luck in this new phase of their academic journey. He said:</p> <p>“You are on the threshold of an exciting academic journey that will culminate in your graduation, when you will go out into the world, equipped with the knowledge, skills, and degree to achieve a rewarding career, and become a productive member of society.”</p> <p>In his welcome address, Dr. Juan Miguel Sanchez Mangold, Provost and Chief Academic Officer, congratulated the students on their success and expressed his appreciation for all the support provided to the freshmen by their families. Addressing the parents and family members of the enrollees, he said:</p> <p>“My colleagues and I know, and fully recognize, that your sons and daughters are here because of all the time, energy, love and, yes, resources that you have invested in their development. You should take full credit for having instilled in them their values, aspirations and abilities that culminated in becoming member of the AUS community which, I must stress, is a major achievement in itself. Thus, on behalf of the entire American University of Sharjah community, I want to thank you for all you have done, and no doubt will continue to do in the future. At the same time, I want to pledge our outmost efforts and dedication to ensure that the young men and women that are joining AUS today, will embark in an intellectually rigorous journey that will transform them into confident and informed global leaders. Leaders who will be prepared, both ethically and intellectually, to shape a better world for the future.”</p> <p>Speaking about some of the recent achievements of the university that underscored the quality of education and opportunities that AUS has to offer, Dr. Mangold said:</p> <p>“One of the achievements that really impressed me as I joined the American University of Sharjah, is the fact that the university was among some of the country’s leading organizations to have been honored at the 2018 United Arab Emirates Pioneers Award. At that event, our chancellor received an award that, quite properly, recognizes AUS for its support of the United Arab Emirates science and research endeavors. This recognition is clear evidence of the significant impact that AUS is having in the development of the country. Importantly, it shows that the university is fully engaged, both locally and nationally, and well aligned with the expectations of our constituents and supporters.</p> <p>“I mention this particular achievement simply because it provides an interesting contrast with another important recognition of the university. As you may know, American University of Sharjah has, once again, topped the Times Higher Education list of universities with the highest percentage of international students globally. This distinction is a good measure of the international presence and impact that AUS has through its students and faculty.”</p> <p>The freshmen cohort for the Spring semester comprises 200 gifted young men and women ready to begin their university life. As part of its mandate, AUS is set to provide them with a challenging and stimulating environment along with financial support in the form of grants and scholarships to help them through their academic journey.</p> <p>The university also welcomes 30 international exchange students from dozens of universities all across the United States of America, The Netherlands, Canada and Bulgaria. Known throughout the region for its multicultural campus environment, AUS has 94 nationalities comprising its student body.</p> <p>Executive Director for Enrollment Management, Ali Shuhaimy also addressed the welcome session. He congratulated the students on their success and on beginning the next phase of their academic career. He said:</p> <p>“I congratulate you for graduating from high school and for being accepted in this selective and competitive institution. You represent the top 20 percent scorers of your school’s graduating class. This achievement is proof of your academic competency which provided the basis for being admitted to AUS; this is a feat you should be proud of. To help you build on your accomplishments, AUS promises to provide all possible and needed support to pave the way for you to continue achieving your goals.”</p> <p>A week-long schedule of on and off campus festivities and events has been organized for the new students, including a dinner reception and library tour, Sharjah and Dubai city tours, games at the Student Center and awareness sessions for parents and students.</p> </div><a class="click2" href="#news2"><span>+Read More</span><span>- Minimize</span></a></div><div class="news-2-item" id="news3"><img src="https://www.aus.edu/sites/default/files/1_30.jpg" alt="News Item 3 Image"><h3>University of Oulu delegation visits AUS</h3><div class="body"><p>A delegation comprising senior officials and faculty members of the University of Oulu in Finland visited the campus of American University of Sharjah (AUS) on January 15.
