      <description>As demand increases across the Arab world for highly trained psychologists, AUS has launched a new program that will help fill the region’s skills gap in the expanding field of psychology. With the region continuing to experience rapid population growth and economic development, it is expected that there will be concurrent growth in psychology-related fields, in both the public and private sectors. The new Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (BAPSY), which will be offered through the AUS College of Arts and Sciences beginning in Fall Semester 2019, will see the first cohort of students graduating in 2023, filling much-needed positions in a variety of sectors from mental health services, to education to human resource management, among others.</description>
